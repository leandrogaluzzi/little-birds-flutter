        "description_md": "Hello everyone.\r\nThis is the deck that performed so well at Euros (most represented deck in the Top, runner up, see the link below).\r\n\r\nhttps://thejoustingpavilion.com/tournaments/6944\r\n \r\nValerio had the idea of this deck and I helped him tweaking it in the past months, as soon as we agreed that Castamere was still the best agenda for the most broken house of the moment.\r\n\r\nWhen the italian crew (and a couple of english friends :P) were training for Euros, I gave all of them this list, pretending it was the best deck possible.\r\nI still think it is.\r\nAll the 12 GJ castamere of the tournament were versions of this list, 6 of them made the cut.\r\n\r\nI don't pretend that this exact list is the best, there are some flexible cards like in any other deck, but the core idea is to abuse what Greyjoys are better at: go first and snowball, and it works againt almost all the good decks of the moment.\r\n\r\nThe Agenda:\r\nI don't like prince but I think GJ crossing is really really good.\r\nCastamere tho can be as much fast as crossing with castamere triggers.\r\nPBtT, Filthy Accusation, Spider's Web, Red Wedding and also Wildfire can help you do some more uo challenges while also giving you an advantage in winning challenges.\r\nMoreover, it's very good to be able to threaten the opponent with your weakest icon.\r\nSo we maintain the fast pace somehow, adding some really useful tools like a soft reset, a direct kill, hand control and some challenge control.\r\n\r\nThe initiative:\r\nWe all know that the GJ mirror is often decided by who triggers Euron first. Why though? Is it all about the Silence.\r\nIn our opinion, what wins the mirror is initiavite.\r\nDraw (iron gates), challenge removals (raiding longship) and intimidate are crucial to the deck, so you REALLY need to go first.\r\nThat's why we decided to add Salty Navigators and Kingsroads to the classic GJ setting.\r\n+12 initiative overall is A LOT.\r\n\r\nThe characters:\r\nMost of the choices are \"standard\" here but we have some interesting choices.\r\nFirst of all: Victarion. With so many warships and given that mirror matches are supposed to be a lot, the other Vic seems like the obvious choice.\r\nTo be honest, the card is better in vacuum. It solves more problems, it serves more purposes.\r\nBut if you are guaranteed to go first and play cards like maiden bane and every captain is a king, and standing effects on demand like pbtt, well, core Vic is a huge backup to Euron's intimidate.\r\nHe makes the deck faster and more consinstent in its goal: go first, kneel all of them, have characters ready to oppose.\r\nHe's also very good to open a way through the int win, thanks to his intimidate on the other two challenge icons.\r\n\r\nBalon: king Balon has two reasons: str buff for the agenda, the king plot. This deck is very good against other midrange decks, but can suffer more control matchups. The king plot can grant you the turn to close the game.\r\nAlso, with double renown he's very fast.\r\n\r\nLorsport shipwright: I still think they're the best 2 gold drop in the game (or the second thanks to Istvan :P). They disappeared from some builds but they are for sure a 3x here.\r\n\r\nSalty navigator: as I wrote init is crucial. Moreover, they feed forced march very well.\r\n\r\nMain plot deck:\r\n2x Forced march: OP plot, should be instantly restricted, nothing more to say.\r\nAt the gates: we tried LSF but the great hall is needed for the next turns.\r\nWe Take Westeros: lol\r\nKing in the North: already discussed.\r\nNothing burns + Weapons at the Door: these are not always useful but they make some of the tougher matchup easier. Builders, Baratheon, Martell can all annoy you a lot with negative attachments. With these and we do not sow you should be able to solve the problem and close the game.\r\n\r\nNo valar: this is a lot about the player. As a non usual GJ player I don't miss it but many GJ players told me they feel more safe with it.\r\nNot a problem, think about the plot you need less in the tournament you are about to play and change it. Same for first snow which is also a good option.\r\n\r\nThat's almost it.\r\n\r\nWhy did I publish this list? \r\nI usually publish interesting and fresh builds to try to shake the meta a bit, trying to give more options to players who are bored by the existing T1 decks.\r\n\r\nThis time though it's because I think this deck is too good, a lot NPE since it snowballs ALL midrange decks but Baratheon since turn 1 and too straightforward and resilient in its gameplan.\r\n\r\nGJ are dominating the field since too much time, we need something to be done because otherwise all the important tournaments will be dominated by this nonsense.\r\n\r\nFeel free to make question, as always I will answer asap.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nNimer",

        "description_md": "The idea is to put pressure on the opponent through both military challenges and the threat of Put to the Sword and/or searching for Public Execution and using it through Forced March or Mellisandre in the following round as well as him/her constantly losing his best cards because of Ghost of High Heart, Queen's Men, Red Priest and of course Seen in Flames.\r\n\r\nThe latter can also be recursed through Isle of Ravens which even though Seen in Flames is a challenge action is still quite powerful from my experience at least against control decks. If you have a bloodcounter on your agenda and Mellisandre in play you can even kneel a character of your opponent after declaring Mil attackers even though you don't have any gold left which can be surprising to some people.\r\n\r\nQueen's Men might seem strange out of a Non-Banner-Baratheon-Deck and it is admittedly. We do play a lot of neutral Characters that we don't mind to much to kneel for the effect, though.\r\n\r\nI chose Exchange of Information over Counting Coppers because from my experience the \r\n+1 gold  can make quite a difference and we have a relatively good spread of card types.\r\n\r\nReturn to the Fields would also be an option for this slot but I felt that it would only really be good if I flip it into an opponents Valar, otherwise I really don't want so sac my characters for draw. That seems rather counterproductive to what the deck tries to accomplish.\r\n\r\nHedge Knight is pretty terrible in this deck and I would gladly play something better if I saw another option. We do want the neutral character here to have enough targets for Queen's Men and he's the only character besides Old Bill Bone that has 2 guaranteed Mil strentgh for the cost of 2 gold, so I went with him.\r\n\r\nOnly 2 Hunting Accidents because 3 can be a bit clunky although it is admittedly your best card against GJ.\r\n\r\nI had Duel in the plotdeck for quite a while but I never actually used it in practice. The idea of playing Duel than killing the surviving 6-/7-coster with Public Execution is great in theory but in practice- Yeah, the situation never actually arises.\r\n\r\n \r\nConstructive criticism is very much appreciated.",
